    <h2>Welcome to BJ's The Island Restuarant!</h2>
    <p>BJ's Diner offers a wide range of delicious American-style dishes in a cozy atmosphere. BJ's Diner offers a wide range of delicious American-style dishes in a cozy atmosphere. BJ's Diner is in Rock Island, Washington. It is part of the Shell Truck Stop so that truckers and travelers have a nice place to take a break and eat some homecooked meals. I love it as it is only not even a 5-minute walk from my house there. The staff is nice, and the food is delicious and quite filling. It's not expensive at all to eat there. In fact, itâ€™s what you expect from any diner to not pay a lot, get a lot of food, usually plenty that I always have leftovers. Also, you get nice homecooked meals. It's comforting really.</p>
